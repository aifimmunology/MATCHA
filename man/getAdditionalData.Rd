\title{Extract additional metadata from a ChAI data or model Object}
\usage{
getAdditionalData(ChAIObj, feature = "summarizedData")
}
\arguments{
\item{ChAIObj}{A ChAI SummarizedExperiment, whether it's a ChAI data object or a ChAI model object}

\item{feature}{The type of data you want. Options include 'summarizedData', which contains population-specific metadata like cell counts, 
'detectionRates', which contains the percentage of a population with transcript of a given gene (scRNA only)
 'Residuals', which contains a SummarizedExperiment of Residuals after modeling
 or 'Variance'/'RandomEffectVariance' which will return a data.frame of variance from a model.}
}
\value{
A SummarizedExperiment object with additional metadata, or a data.frame of variance.
}
\description{
\code{getAdditionalData} Returns a wide range of metadata from ChAI objects, including
                 population-level metadata (scRNA, and scATAC), gene detection rates within a sample-celltype (scRNA),
                  residuals (models), and random effect variance (models)
